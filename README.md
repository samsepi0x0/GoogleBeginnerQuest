#### Quest 1 -  Novosibirsk - Chemical plant 
        Category: Web
  You have now investigated the chemical plant. Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary, even though the workers acted somewhat passive, but that’s not a good enough to track. It seems like you have a new voice mail from the boss: "Hello there, AGENT! It seems like the corporation that owns the plant was informed by an anonymous source that you would arrive, and therefore they were prepared for your visit, but your colleague AGENT X has a lead in Moscow, we’ve already booked you a flight. FIRST CLASS of course. In fact if you look out of the window, you should be able to see a black car arriving now, and it will carry you to the airport.
  
  "Good luck!"

  #### Quest 2 -  Moscow - Apartment 
      Category: Misc
   Well, it’s a rather gloomy and messy apartment, a faint shade is cast from the almost covered master window upon the worn wall. It smells very burnt, and there's a cracked bottle in the sink that suggests some kind of experiment. Someone must have left in a hurry. Thinking about it, do you want to: Look at the beautiful view of the Kremlin from the window or search the apartment thoroughly.

 #### Quest 3 - Moscow - Street
      Category: Programming
   You’re closing in on the motorcycle, but before you have time to act, the person turns to a small path, which is impossible to follow by car. You will never see them again, but wait... They dropped something, a small bag! You look inside of it, and you see what looks to be like an ancient amulet. You return to AGENT X and she tells you that the amulet can be a lead, and that you should return to the base to begin some research.
